## Introduction

This repository serves as evidence of my successful completion of the Python and SQL courses offered by Mimo. Throughout the Python course, I gained a solid understanding of the language and learned various concepts and techniques that form the core of Python programming. From basic syntax to more advanced topics like object-oriented programming, I explored a wide range of Python's capabilities.

Additionally, the SQL course provided me with a comprehensive understanding of structured query language. I learned how to design and manipulate databases, execute complex queries, and optimize database performance.
